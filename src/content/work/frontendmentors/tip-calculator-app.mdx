{/* # Hello, take a look at this challenge!

> That's not my first challenge taken, but I want to start here from that because it's simply enough to complete it in one take, and its seem to be fun :)

Check the button of the page when the solution are. It's `vue` component inside `astro` and it's mind blowing ðŸ¤¯

# Challenge brief from Frontendmentors

ðŸ‘‰ [Frontendmentors page with this challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX)

# My feeling about that

## I have to start with astro - it's amazing pice of software. Possibilites are great.

At the start I saw how everything is render on the server site - performance goes to the moon ðŸŒ™

When I started working on this Vue component I realize its also server rendred - huuge! ðŸ¤¯

But it's one downsite - during development you want have access to `console.log` direct in your browser. By default when it's server rendered everything happend in your shell / server.
To enable this you can you ðŸ‘‰ [one of the astro directive](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientonly) `client:only="vue"`. Of course use tech of your choice `client:only="react"` or whatever astro is capable of

## Ok letâ€™s talk about vue - itâ€™s just amaze me

look at this:

```vue
</script>
const colors = {
    veryDarkCyan: 'hsl(183, 100%, 15%)',
}
</script>

<template>
    <div>
        <h1> Lorem Ipsum</h1>
    </div>
</template>

<style>
h1 {
    color: v-bind('colors.veryDarkCyan')
}

```

And its work's ! I don't know what vue version bring this but if I'm corret when I working with vue on enterprise app 6 years ago it wasn't avaibale
