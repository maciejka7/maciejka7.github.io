# Brief

> Your challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
